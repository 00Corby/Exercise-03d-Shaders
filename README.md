# Exercise-03d-Shaders

Exercise for MSCH-C220, 30 September 2021

This exercise will add several juicy features to our match-3 game. You may not want to use them all at the same time, but this is a chance to explore a variety of techniques. The exercise will provide you with several features that should move you towards the implementation of Project 03.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-03d-Shaders. Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F21 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location; make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-03d-Shaders" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Open Godot. In the Project Manager, tap the "Import" button. Tap "Browse" and navigate to the repository folder. Select the project.godot file and tap "Open".

If you run the project, you will see a main menu followed by a simple match-3 game (using Godot icons as tiles). Your task will be to modify (by adding more juiciness to) the tiles.

Test the game and make sure it is working correctly. You should be able to see all the effects we added to the tiles.

Quit Godot. In GitHub desktop, you should now see the updated files listed in the left panel. In the bottom of that panel, type a Summary message (something like "Completes the exercise") and press the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see your updated files with the time when they were changed.

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-03d-Shaders) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
